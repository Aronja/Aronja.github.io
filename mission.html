                During this workshop students learn to set up a Raspberry Pi and how to use the programming language Python3 to write a simple programme for the mini computer. 
                Then, they will use a relay, a submersed pump to build a watering system for plants.

                Some of the most important skills for every engineer, are solving problems by reading documentation, making logical conclusions about what you've learned and debugging your code. 
                During this workshop, students will be working in teams and will with assistance try to solve problems in a team.

                This workshop will be aimed at people who cannot afford formal education, refugees, single parents, and minorities in tech.

                It does not take expensive equipment to learn Software Engineering skills. People can learn these skills anywhere as long as the have a computer and internet connection. Becoming a Software Engineer does not require people to go to university or have a certain financial background, which allows for a social mobility, which is not found in many other careers.

                The job itself also does not discriminate, people can work from home, which avoid accessibility issues.
                Also, people can often work relatively flexible hours, which might allow them to pick up their children from school. 
                Additionally, jobs in the tech industry usually allow people to be financially independent even in a junior role.
